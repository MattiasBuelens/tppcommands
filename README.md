# Twitch Plays Pokemon Commands

The 3DS touch screen is hard to press in Twitch Plays Pokemon. This userscript offers a way to press oft-used buttons on the touch screen, like the different attacks, mons and so on, by converting predefined commands into coordinates that the stream accepts.


These commands are now optimised for Pok√©mon X, although most are not yet implemented.  Keep checking back for more

Commands with more than one set of coordinates means that one of these coordinate sets are chosen at random.  Sometimes one input is more common than others.

Simply type them as you would any other command (a, b, left, etc.) in the Twitch chat -- i.e. it works with extra spaces/text and no matter what casing you use, as long as you start your message with it.
